Notes based on [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

The Algorithms are impletemented in Octave and Python numpy.
Each with unit tests.

Running octave tests
open octave console, go to insde the folder you want to test and run `runtests .`
There is probably a better way to run all test without entering the console, still haven't figured that out.

Running python tests
`python -m unittest discover ./python '*.py'`

This is work on progress. Some of the implementation are broken.
